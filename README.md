#### Airflow Telegram Plugin

After i started to learn and tinker with Apache Airflow, i 
realised that there is no operator for Telegram.

Since i already use telegram and also had a small Telegram bot using pyTelegramBotAPI, i wanted to use
the Telegram API to send messages through my bot within an Airflow DAG.

This repo is for creating an Airflow Telegram Plugin.
